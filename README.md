k-Means Clustering

I- Introduction
- K-means (unsupervised learning/clustering algorithm) implemented in MATLAB
- “kmeans.m” is a script that generates uniformly distributed data points into equal clusters.
- “hungarian.m” is a script that contains Hungarian algorithm solving k-means phase.
II- Algorithm details
- The program runs the entire process multiple times with different initializations of centroids
- Then, it uses the run which has the best mean squared error between points and their assigned centroids.
- For the k-means algorithm phase, applied Hungarian algorithm.
